These good bacteria, similar to ones already in your body, play an important role in keeping your gut balanced. This balance is key for overall health. The idea of using probiotics for health started in the early 1900s. But research on these microorganisms is still pretty new. You can find probiotics in fermented foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi. You can also take probiotic supplements. Probiotics are used for digestive issues and general health.</p><p>Probiotics affect your gastrointestinal tract in a few ways. They make short-chain fatty acids that feed intestinal cells. They improve gut barrier function. And they produce neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. These impact mood and thinking.</p><p>By regulating the immune system and promoting a balanced gut, probiotics can help with:</p><ul><li>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</li><li>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</li><li>Allergies</li><li>Mental health issues like depression and anxiety</li></ul><p>Probiotics have wide-ranging benefits. They:</p><ul><li>Support digestive health by maintaining good gut bacteria. This alleviates GI disorder symptoms and prevents diarrhea.</li><li>Influence mental health through the gut-brain axis. This can potentially reduce anxiety and depression.</li><li>May benefit skin health, weight management, heart health, and immune function. Research here is emerging.</li></ul><p>However, effectiveness varies based on the strains used and conditions treated. So it's essential to consult your doctor for advice tailored to you.</p><p>Despite the promising benefits, some controversies exist around probiotics. More research is needed on:</p><ul><li>How well different strains work</li><li>Their impact on various health conditions</li></ul><p>Additionally, probiotics aren't regulated by the FDA. This leads to variability in quality and effectiveness of products on the market.</p><p>So it's crucial to choose probiotics from reputable sources. And seek guidance from knowledgeable healthcare professionals. This will maximize the potential benefits.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/probitoics-benefits.jpg" alt="What are probiotics" width="1344" height="768" sizes="(min-width: 1260px) calc(3.22vw + 703px), (min-width: 900px) calc(50.59vw + 116px), (min-width: 840px) calc(5vw + 684px), calc(85.58vw + 23px)" srcset="https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/responsive/probitoics-benefits-xs.jpg 320w, https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/responsive/probitoics-benefits-sm.jpg 480w, https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/responsive/probitoics-benefits-md.jpg 768w"></figure><h2>What are probiotics?</h2><p>Probiotics are "live microorganisms that can improve your health when eaten in the right amounts," says the official definition<sup>[1]</sup>. These healthy bacteria are similar to the ones already in your gut. They help keep the balance between good and bad bugs in your digestive system<sup>[2]</sup>. The word "probiotics" comes from Latin and Greek words meaning "for life." This refers to their helpful effects<sup>[2]</sup>. You can find probiotics in foods like yogurt, some cheeses, and pickled veggies<sup>[2]</sup>. You can also take probiotic supplements. Doctors often recommend them for digestive issues like colic, constipation, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), lactose intolerance, and ulcerative colitis<sup>[3]</sup>.</p><h3>A little history</h3><p>The idea of using probiotics for health started in the early 1900s. But scientists are still learning about these microorganisms<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><h3>Common probiotic bacteria</h3><p>The most popular probiotics come from two bacteria groups - bifidobacteria (abbreviated B.) and lactobacillus (abbreviated L.). You'll see these letters on food labels, followed by the specific bacteria name. Like L. acidophilus<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><h3>A note of caution</h3><p>Even though studies show promise, probiotics work differently depending on the type and condition. Probiotics aren't regulated by the FDA either. So talk to your doctor to find the best one for you<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p><strong>The human digestive system</strong> has lots of different tiny living things in it, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The types and activities of these microbes, together called the gut microbiome or gut flora, can really affect people's health, both good and bad.</p><p><strong>Probiotics</strong> are the good gut bugs that usually do their work in the digestive tract. They influence the other gut microbes in different ways. Probiotics can temporarily take up residence in a person's gut lining in very individual patterns. This depends on what microbes are already there, the type of probiotic, and where in the digestive tract.</p><p><strong>Probiotics help the body</strong> by making short-chain fatty acids like butyrate. Butyrate feeds the cells lining the gut to strengthen the intestinal barrier. This leads to a healthier gut and better overall health. Probiotics also make mood chemicals like serotonin and dopamine, which are good for thinking clearly and handling stress. These good bacteria connect to the brain through the vagus nerve, which helps control mood. For example, a study found women who ate probiotic yogurt twice a day for four weeks felt calmer when shown angry faces compared to those who didn't eat the yogurt.</p><p>Probiotics also help <strong>balance the immune system</strong> by promoting good gut microbes. An imbalanced microbiome, where bad bugs outnumber good ones, is linked to things like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), allergies, depression and anxiety. Supporting good gut microbes with probiotics and prebiotics can improve this balance and potentially help with these conditions.</p><p>Moreover, probiotics <strong>boost the body's defenses</strong> by strengthening the gut lining barrier, sticking better to the gut wall, making antibacterial stuff, and crowding out harmful germs. They also modulate the immune system, helping keep the body in balance and ready to protect itself. These complex interactions happen through various signaling pathways, including ones involving pattern recognition molecules like Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/probiotic-top-benefits-2.jpg" alt="health benefits of probiotics" width="1344" height="768" sizes="(min-width: 1260px) calc(3.22vw + 703px), (min-width: 900px) calc(50.59vw + 116px), (min-width: 840px) calc(5vw + 684px), calc(85.58vw + 23px)" srcset="https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/responsive/probiotic-top-benefits-2-xs.jpg 320w, https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/responsive/probiotic-top-benefits-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/responsive/probiotic-top-benefits-2-md.jpg 768w"></figure><h2>Health Benefits of Probiotics</h2><p><strong>Probiotics</strong>, also called <strong>"good bacteria,"</strong> have many health benefits. They help keep your gut healthy by balancing the bacteria. Probiotics can help with digestion, heart health, immunity, and mental health.</p><h2>Digestive Health</h2><p>Probiotics are well known for helping digestion. They keep your gut bacteria balanced, which helps digest food and absorb nutrients. Probiotics can help with digestive problems like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Some probiotics can prevent diarrhea or make it less severe, including travelers' diarrhea.</p><h2>Mental Health</h2><p>There is a connection between your gut and brain called the gut-brain axis. Probiotics affect this axis and may help with anxiety and depression. More research is looking at how probiotics support mental health.</p><h2>Skin Health</h2><p>Probiotics may also help skin conditions like acne and eczema. Taking probiotics by mouth or putting them on your skin might reduce inflammation, but more studies are needed.</p><h2>Weight Management</h2><p>Probiotics could play a role in weight loss. Gut bacteria make a substance called acetate that may control appetite and increase metabolism. But more research is needed in humans.</p><h2>Heart Health</h2><p>Early research shows probiotics may support heart health. A high-fiber diet with probiotics makes substances called SCFAs. These lower cholesterol, blood pressure and inflammation. That lowers the risk of heart disease and stroke.</p><h2>Immune Function</h2><p>Probiotics boost the immune system in big ways. They help make antibodies and keep gut bacteria balanced. Both are key for a strong immune response. Some probiotics interact directly with immune cells to potentially prevent infections, allergies and autoimmune issues. Studies show probiotics can shorten colds and make vaccines more effective.</p><p>Overall, probiotics are important for good health. Eating foods with probiotics or taking supplements can be a good long-term health strategy.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/probiotic-benefits-nervous-system.jpg" alt="Probiotic strains and their benefits" width="1344" height="768" sizes="(min-width: 1260px) calc(3.22vw + 703px), (min-width: 900px) calc(50.59vw + 116px), (min-width: 840px) calc(5vw + 684px), calc(85.58vw + 23px)" srcset="https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/responsive/probiotic-benefits-nervous-system-xs.jpg 320w, https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/responsive/probiotic-benefits-nervous-system-sm.jpg 480w, https://probioticsdigest.com/media/posts/5/responsive/probiotic-benefits-nervous-system-md.jpg 768w"></figure><h2>Specific Probiotic Strains and Their Benefits</h2><p> </p><h2><strong>Bacillus Species</strong></h2><p>Bacillus species can:</p><ul><li>Restore gut microflora</li><li>Fight inflammation</li><li>Make vitamins like B vitamins, carotenoids, and vitamin K</li><li>Release digestive enzymes</li><li>Fight infections in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and urinary tract</li></ul><p>One study found Bacillus coagulans increased good bacteria and improved immune function in older adults. However, some Bacillus species can:</p><ul><li>Make toxins</li><li>Cause infections</li><li>Be antibiotic resistant</li></ul><p>Some products have been contaminated with germs. So it's important to choose products from companies with good quality control.</p><h2>Bifidobacterium Species</h2><p>Bifidobacteria can:</p><ul><li>Improve digestion of lactose</li><li>Maybe prevent or reduce diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</li><li>Improve cholesterol</li><li>Strengthen the intestinal barrier</li></ul><p>Specific types like B. breve, B. longum subsp. infantis, B. bifidum, and B. longum subsp. longum are common in babies, especially breastfed babies. These probiotics:</p><ul><li>Make B vitamins, vitamin C, and vitamin K</li><li>Help absorb minerals by lowering stomach acid</li></ul><p>For example, B. bifidum may help prevent gastrointestinal infections and colon cancer, but more research is needed.</p><h2>Lactobacillus Species</h2><p>Lactobacillus bacteria:</p><ul><li>Make lactic acid linked to health benefits</li><li>Are important in the digestive tract, mouth, and vagina</li><li>May improve digestion of lactose and micronutrients</li><li>May reduce antibiotic diarrhea risk</li><li>May prevent vaginal infections</li></ul><p>Some types are L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, and L. reuteri. These may:</p><ul><li>Lower cholesterol</li><li>Improve weight loss in obesity</li><li>Prevent or improve eczema in kids</li></ul><p>For example, L. gasseri has antimicrobial properties against Staphylococcus aureus and may aid weight management by reducing body fat. L. salivarius makes antibodies targeting germs like Salmonella, promoting digestive and immune health. Additionally, L. plantarum supports digestion, boosts immunity, and can relieve occasional diarrhea.</p><h2>Saccharomyces Species</h2><p>The Saccharomyces genus includes yeast species found in soil or plants. Saccharomyces boulardii is a studied yeast probiotic used for GI disorders since it survives high temperatures and low pH. But Saccharomyces cerevisiae, though used in baking and brewing, can cause infections in sick people. So it's not recommended for critically ill or immunocompromised people.</p><h2>Sources of Probiotics</h2><p>Probiotics can be found in different foods and supplements. Each one has unique benefits depending on the types of bacteria they have. The most common probiotics are from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium groups. These are often found in fermented foods and supplements. Yeasts like Saccharomyces boulardii can also be probiotics.</p><h2>Probiotic Foods</h2><h3>Yogurt</h3><p>Yogurt is one of the most well-known probiotic foods. It's made by fermenting milk or cream with live, active cultures. These usually come from the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium groups. The probiotics help break down lactose and make lactic acid. This can lower cholesterol and help with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.</p><h3>Sauerkraut</h3><p>Sauerkraut is fermented cabbage. It has lots of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from the Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus groups. This probiotic food can help digestion and improve blood sugar and cholesterol levels.</p><h3>Kimchi</h3><p>Kimchi is a Korean food made from fermented napa cabbage, radishes, and other vegetables. It has probiotic bacteria from Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium types. Studies show kimchi may improve blood sugar and cholesterol.</p><h3>Kefir</h3><p>Kefir is a fermented milk drink. It has many probiotic bacteria and yeasts. It's especially high in vitamin K2, which is good for bones and heart health. Kefir can also help metabolic health, weight loss, and bone density.</p><h3>Kombucha</h3><p>Kombucha is fermented tea with yeasts like Candida and bacteria like Komagataeibacter. Animal and cell studies show it may have antimicrobial, antifungal, and anticancer properties. But more human studies are needed.</p><h3>Pickles</h3><p>Fermented pickles made with water and salt can be good probiotic sources. They have various lactic acid bacteria. But their probiotic strength may decrease if stored too long.</p><h2>Scientific Studies on Probiotics</h2><p>Probiotics are actually live microorganisms that can help people out when taken in the right amounts. Studies have shown probiotics play a big role in keeping people healthy, especially for digestion and the immune system. They help keep the balance of good and bad gut bacteria, also called the microbiome. This balance is really important for overall health and wellbeing.</p><h3>Digestive Health</h3><p>One of the best proven benefits of probiotics is how they positively affect digestive health. Probiotics are known to help with all kinds of digestion issues - colic, constipation, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), lactose intolerance, and ulcerative colitis. The World Health Organization says probiotics are live organisms that can be good for you in the right doses. They help digest food and absorb nutrients more efficiently. Studies have found different probiotic strains offer specific benefits. For example, Lactobacillus acidophilus can help lower cholesterol and ease IBS symptoms by breaking down lactose and making lactic acid. Also, Bifidobacterium bifidus has been shown to effectively treat diarrhea and certain inflammatory bowel conditions.</p><h3>Immune System Support</h3><p>Probiotics also have significant benefits for the immune system. Research shows these microorganisms can prevent and improve allergic disorders like eczema and allergic rhinitis in infants. They can also help with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults. Furthermore, probiotics may potentially help treat metabolic disorders, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes.</p><h3>How Probiotics Work</h3><p>Probiotics help health by changing the levels of microorganisms in the gut. This improves the overall mix, or microbiome. When the gut microbiome is out of whack - called dysbiosis - probiotics can restore balance. They increase good bacteria and reduce bad bacteria. This balance is essential for a strong immune system, mental health, and overall health.</p><p>Disclaimer: Article above is rewritten using <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16n5GQUzwiM5GnFWK74m9XxRsqXNJkM0c/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanford Storm AI</a> to make it more readable. </p><p>References<br>[1]: <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/dairy-health/prebiotics-probiotics-and-the-microbes-in-your-gut-key-to-your-digestive-health/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Prebiotics, probiotics and the microbes in your gut: </a><br>[2]:<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/types-of-probiotics" rel="nofollow"> 6 Most Common Types of Probiotics - Healthline</a><br>[3]: <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/probiotics-and-digestive-health" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Probiotics and Digestive Health: Benefits, Risks, and More</a><br>[4]: Probiotics: What They Are, Benefits &amp;
